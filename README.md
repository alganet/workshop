**workshop** is an automator tool that works everywhere.

---

### Simple

workshop *does not need setup or compilation*. Just download the source
and run.

[**See usage instructions**](doc/usage.md).

### Small and Modular

workshop loader will get its modules from the internet as you use it.

Browse the module list (soon).

### Built on Standards

The workshop architecture brings *many standards* under a single
umbrella of compatibility.

Read about the architecture (soon).
