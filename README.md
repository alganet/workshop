**workshop** is an automator tool that works everywhere.

---

### Zero Dependencies

By building on top of technology always present in operating systems,
workshop does not need additional setup. Just download and run.

[**See download instructions**](doc/installation.md).

### Small and Modular

You don't need to download all of the tools at once. The 10KB workshop
loader will get its modules from the internet as you use it.

[**Browse the module list**](doc/modules.md).

### Write Once

workshop tools and libraries are designed to work in many platforms
natively, without having to detect or abstract them.

[**Read about the architecture**](doc/architecture.md).
